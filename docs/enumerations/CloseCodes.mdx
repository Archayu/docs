## Enumeration Members

### Normal

> **Normal**: `1000`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:11](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L11)

The connection successfully completed the purpose for which it was created.

***

### GoingAway

> **GoingAway**: `1001`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:17](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L17)

The endpoint is going away, either because of a server failure or
the browser navigating away from the page that opened the connection.

***

### ProtocolError

> **ProtocolError**: `1002`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:22](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L22)

The endpoint is terminating the connection due to a protocol error.

***

### UnsupportedData

> **UnsupportedData**: `1003`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:28](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L28)

The connection is being terminated because the endpoint received data of a type it cannot accept.
(For example, a text-only endpoint received binary data.)

***

### Reserved

> **Reserved**: `1004`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:33](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L33)

Reserved. A meaning might be defined in the future.

***

### NoStatusReceived

> **NoStatusReceived**: `1005`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:38](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L38)

Reserved. Indicates that no status code was provided even though one was expected.

***

### Abnormal

> **Abnormal**: `1006`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:43](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L43)

Reserved. Indicates that a connection was closed abnormally (that is, with no close frame being sent) when a status code is expected.

***

### InvalidFramePayloadData

> **InvalidFramePayloadData**: `1007`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:48](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L48)

The endpoint is terminating the connection because a message was received that contained inconsistent data (e.g., non-UTF-8 data within a text message).

***

### PolicyViolation

> **PolicyViolation**: `1008`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:53](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L53)

The endpoint is terminating the connection because it received a message that violates its policy. This is a generic status code, used when codes 1003 and 1009 are not suitable.

***

### MessageTooBig

> **MessageTooBig**: `1009`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:58](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L58)

The endpoint is terminating the connection because a data frame was received that is too large.

***

### MandatoryExtension

> **MandatoryExtension**: `1010`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:63](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L63)

The client is terminating the connection because it expected the server to negotiate one or more extension, but the server didn't.

***

### InternalError

> **InternalError**: `1011`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:68](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L68)

The server is terminating the connection because it encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

***

### ServiceRestart

> **ServiceRestart**: `1012`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:73](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L73)

The server is terminating the connection because it is restarting.

***

### TryAgainLater

> **TryAgainLater**: `1013`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:78](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L78)

The server is terminating the connection due to a temporary condition, e.g., it is overloaded and is casting off some of its clients.

***

### BadGateway

> **BadGateway**: `1014`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:83](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L83)

The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server. This is similar to 502 HTTP Status Code.

***

### TLSHandshake

> **TLSHandshake**: `1015`

Defined in: [Typings/Node/Node.ts:88](https://github.com/Archayu/discolink/blob/ddfd70ea55cc6996bf3567765f64fb3824cd3f79/src/Typings/Node/Node.ts#L88)

Reserved. Indicates that the connection was closed due to a failure to perform a TLS handshake (e.g., the server certificate can't be verified).
